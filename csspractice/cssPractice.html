        LANGLEY, VA - A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.
</p>
<p>
    According to the report, sections of the documents - "almost invariably the most crucial passages" - are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.
</p>
<p> CIA Director <b>Porter Goss</b> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as: </p>
<ul>
    <li>the Cold War</li>
    <li>the civil-rights movement</li>
    <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
</ul>
